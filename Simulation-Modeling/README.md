This modeling use Arena to conduct some experiments with the following situation:

University of Cincinnati (UC) holds the career fair twice a year.
The student needs to sign in at the front door by swiping their student ID at the registration station. A name tag with their graduation year and major will be printed and their attendance is recorded in the system for the future research. While leaving, students are invited to take a post-survey in paper form and get a raffle tickets for lucky draw. UC also recruit several volunteers, for directing students from the entry to registration stations and inviting students to fill a post-survey while students leaving.

The main model is to simulate the career fair from studentsâ€™ arrival to their leaving the site. The purpose is to understand how many registration tables, survey tables and volunteers could lead to the situation that most of the students could attend the career fair, fill out the post-survey and at the same time do not use too much time on waiting in the line.

The original model is stored in ZhaoYue-Project.doe and several possible optimizations are included in Simulation Project Optimization Alternative 1.opt, Simulation Project Optimization Alternative 2.opt, and Simulation Project Optimization Alternative 3.opt.

Zhao,Yue-Simulation Modeling Project.pdf is the final report for this project.
